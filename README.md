**Your AI pair programmer's memory system.** Seamlessly integrate persistent task tracking with GitHub Copilot and VS Code's native AI featuresâ€”giving your coding assistant perfect memory across sessions.

> *"Finally, an AI assistant that remembers what we planned to do next."*

## Why Agent Todos?

VS Code's agent mode is brilliant at writing code but lacks persistent memory between sessions. AI can spot TODO comments but can't maintain an actionable task list that evolves with your project.

**Agent Todos bridges this gap** by giving VS Code's AI ecosystem a dedicated memory system for tracking tasks, context, and priorities across coding sessions.

## Key Features

- **ðŸ¤– Native VS Code Integration**: Built-in `todo_read` and `todo_write` tools that work seamlessly with GitHub Copilot and VS Code's agent mode
- **ðŸ§  Persistent AI Memory**: AI can read, update, and remember tasks between sessionsâ€”no more lost context
- **ðŸ“‹ Visual Task Management**: Interactive tree view in VS Code's Explorer with one-click status updates
- **ðŸ”— Auto-Sync with Copilot**: Automatically inject todos into `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for enhanced AI context
- **âš¡ Instant AI Execution**: Run todos directly in VS Code Chat with context-aware assistance
- **ðŸŽ¯ Smart Organization**: Subtasks, priorities, rich descriptions, and three-state workflow (pending â†’ in-progress â†’ completed)
- **ðŸ”§ Flexible Integration**: Works as VS Code extension or standalone MCP server for advanced integrations

## How It Works

1. **Install** â†’ Extension adds todo tools to GitHub Copilot automatically
2. **Plan** â†’ Ask Copilot to create and organize your development tasks  
3. **Track** â†’ Visual tree view shows progress; AI remembers everything
4. **Execute** â†’ Run todos directly in VS Code Chat with full context

### ï¿½ Example Workflow

```
You: "Create a todo list for implementing user authentication"

GitHub Copilot: "I'll create a structured plan for user authentication..."
âœ… Creates organized todos with subtasks and priorities
âœ… Todos appear in Explorer tree view  
âœ… AI remembers your plan for future sessions

You: "What should I work on next?"

GitHub Copilot: "Based on your todos, let's start with the JWT middleware..."
âœ… Suggests next action from your todo list
âœ… Updates progress as you complete tasks
```

## Quick Start

### For AI Assistants (Recommended)

1. **Install** the extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. **Chat with GitHub Copilot**: Your AI now has `todo_read` and `todo_write` tools automatically
3. **Start planning**: Ask Copilot to create todos, track progress, or suggest next steps
4. **Watch the magic**: Todos appear in the Explorer tree view and sync with Copilot's memory

**Try asking GitHub Copilot:**
- *"Create a todo list for implementing user authentication"*
- *"What should I work on next based on my current todos?"*  
- *"Mark the database setup task as completed and suggest the next step"*

## Get Started

### Quick Setup

1. **Install** from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=digitarald.agent-todos)
2. **Open VS Code Chat** and start planning with GitHub Copilot
3. **Enable Auto-sync** (optional): `Settings > Extensions > Agent Todos > Auto-inject`

### Try These Commands

Ask GitHub Copilot:
- *"Create a todo list for implementing user authentication"*
- *"What should I work on next based on my current todos?"*  
- *"Mark the database setup task as completed and suggest the next step"*
